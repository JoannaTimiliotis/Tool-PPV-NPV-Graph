# Tool-PPV-NPV-Graph
In clinical medicine Bayesian methods are used to establish the probability that a patient has a particular condition given the results of the test used and the prevalence of the condition in the population tested. 

This tool shows the percentage of patients that having tested positive for a condition, do actually have the condition being tested. 
The probability that the subject has the condition is largely dependent on the frequency of the condition in the population tested (prevalence).
The tool allows the user to set the values for the test's accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and displays a graph which 
shows how the positive and negative predictive values change with the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

Usage <br>
Enter the values of sensitivity and specificity on the left panel. 
The graph depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test and tells how the positive and negative predicted Values change as a function of the prevalence.
